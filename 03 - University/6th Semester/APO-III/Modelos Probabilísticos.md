## Concept Overview

Three basic components in **probability models**
- The set of all possible outcomes, denoted $\Omega$.
- The collection of all sets of outcomes (events), denoted $A$ 
- And a probability measure $\mathbb{P}$ assigns a probability to each event.

> The following examples are based on the case of flipping a coin in the air.

##### Sample space (Ω)
$$\Omega = \{ \text{Heads}, \text{Tails} \}$$

##### Event Collection (A)
$$A = \{ \emptyset, \{ \text{Heads} \}, \{ \text{Tails} \},\{ \text{Heads}, \text{Tails} \} \}$$

##### Probability Measure (P)
$$\mathbb{P}(\text{Heads}) = 0.5 \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\: \mathbb{P}(\text{Tails}) = 0.5$$

**How do we assign a probability to an event?**

## Joint Probability

The expression $P(A ∩ B)$ or equivalently $P(A, B)$ stands for the probability of the
events $A ∩ B$. represents the joint probability of two events A and B occurring at
the same time.

## Conditional Probability

The probability of an event given that another event has occurred. It can be calculated using the formula: $P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B).$

**Ex.** If there are 10 balls ($7$ red, $3$ blue), the probability of drawing a red ball after drawing a blue one is $P(\text{Red } | \text{ Blue}) = \frac{7}{10}$.
