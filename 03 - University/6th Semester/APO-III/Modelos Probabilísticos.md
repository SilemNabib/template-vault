## Concept Overview

Three basic components in **probability models**
- The set of all possible outcomes, denoted $\Omega$.
- The collection of all sets of outcomes (events), denoted $A$ 
- And a probability measure $\mathbb{P}$ assigns a probability to each event.

> The following examples are based on the case of flipping a coin in the air.

##### Sample space (Î©)
$$\Omega = \{ \text{Heads}, \text{Tails} \}$$

##### Event Collection (A)
$$A = \{ \emptyset, \{ \text{Heads} \}, \{ \text{Tails} \},\{ \text{Heads}, \text{Tails} \} \}$$

##### Probability Measure (P)
$$\mathbb{P}(\text{Heads}) = 0.5 \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\: \mathbb{P}(\text{Tails}) = 0.5$$
